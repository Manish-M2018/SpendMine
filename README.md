# SpendMine
The android application takes in the details of the student and his expenditure and checks whether he is spending wisely. <br>
If he does, he is given 'fluffy' coins. <br>
There is a leaderboard to see how they compare with other students. <br>
They can redeem the fluffy coins in entertainment places who are tied up with us like a cinema halls, opera etc. <br>
If they spend lesser than the estimated amount for entertainment, they get more fluffy coins.<br>

<br><br>
Probable future of SpendMine:<br>
Spend Mine would display graphs of the expenditures of the students and tie up with online payment applications like Paypal in order to directly track the amount spent by a student. <br>
We would also provide personalised recommendations to the users as to which entertainment location is suitable for them according to their budget/expenditure.
